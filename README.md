## Introduction
Dorm Swap and Shop is a classifieds app that connects college students to buy, sell, and trade any unwanted goods. Our users do not have to worry about scams, spam, fraud, or personal safety, as the application will only authorize users specific to the college or university using the app.

## Problem Statement
College become home away from home and over time, students end up with items they don't longer need. This includes textbooks, gadgets, furniture, home goods, etc. Using Dorm Swap and Shop will allow students to quickly get rid of unwanted items right within the campus community. Our app is a safe alternative to other major competitors.

## Tech Stack
### Frontend:
* [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
* [Expo](https://expo.dev/)

Expo and React Native are the primary front-end technologies used to develop this app. Expo is the framework for building cross platform apps and React Native is the Javascript library used for creative native mobile user interfaces.


### Backend:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

The backend is powered by Node.js with Express.js for server side logic and Google Firebase for data storage and real-time database functionality.  

## Installation and Local Testing
To develop and run this front-end locally, you will need to have Expo CLI and Node.js installed. Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. Install Expo CLI globally: `npm install -g expo-cli`.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-project.git`.
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-project`.
4. Install project dependencies: `npm install`.
5. Start the development server: `npx expo start --tunnel` or `npm start`.
6. Follow the Expo CLI instructions to run the app on an emulator, device, or web browser.


## Demo
> This could be a git or something of how to use the app (when it's built and not just spinning up locally).
